# Code and Stay Woke
 This is a Code & Digital Activist site, kiosk or hub for developers
 to integrate their tech skills for social and just causes. The purpose 
 of this project is to bring social and cultural awareness to a growing,
 diverse tech community by enabling the community to be informed of 
 social issues.

 In a world, of software development and data sciences at big companies and insulated work spaces, tech workers are not known to be into political activism. However, that is changing due to the political dynamics of the United States. One of the growing concerns within the tech industry is itâ€™s very own demographic composition.
